## Ways of contributing

We've done our best to make it as simple as possible for anyone to contribute:

* **Contribute using Git**: follow our step-by-step instructions (no technical knowledge required) or directly fork the repo and create a pull request.
* **Quick suggestions**: submit your comments or suggestions using the form below.

## Contributor responsibilities

The following should be kept in mind when creating content:

* Be sure the material you propose comply with copyright regulations.
* Please adhere to our style guide for consistency's sake.
* You might find the Markdown cheat sheet useful in applying the right layout.
* Check out the Editors checklist.
* Make sure that the contributors' section of your page credits anyone who authored or reviewed.

## Acknowledgement of contributors

Contributors will be shown at the bottom of the page if listed in the metadata of the markdown file. All contributors will also be displayed in the contributors page. If you want to link your GitHub account, ORCID or email address, please add your name and corresponding information to the CONTRIBUTORS file.

## Ownership of content

The content on the Lesson Plans is a community effort, with many people contributing. Decisions are driven by consensus among the contributors and reviewers. 

The information is updated on a regular basis, and anybody can make changes to it without informing others. However, the Lesson Plan editors will make sure that material is only changed for valid reasons and that it accurately represents the general consensus on any given subject. 

If you find any content unsatisfactory, please feel free to create an issue about it.
