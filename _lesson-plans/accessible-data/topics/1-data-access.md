## Topic, definition and scope



* Difference between sensitive and personal data 
* Federated data access (local sources)
* Relevant legislations, policies, and recommendations


---

## FAIR element(s)



* A - Accessible: working with the community of researchers who have sensitive data and wish to know how to enable FAIR for data that needs to have controlled access.


---

## Summary of Tasks / Actions



* Use case: https://doi.org/10.25504/FAIRsharing.dab53d [https://fairsharing.org/4203](https://fairsharing.org/4203) or any of the other data [dashboards](https://fairsharing.org/search?userDefinedTags=Dashboard) with FAIRsharing, which deals with sensitive data.
* FAIRsharing’s educational factsheet on databases
* Exercise:Define types of access modes (tip: use examples from own research field)
* Exercise: Reviewing case study (FAIRness of it) and how it can be improved
* Exercise: Prepare (contribute with) a use case from your institution - collect via GitHub?
