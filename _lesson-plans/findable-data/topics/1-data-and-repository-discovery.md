## Topic, definition and scope

* “Everyone has the right to share in scientific advancement and its benefits” \
Article 27, Universal Declaration of Human Rights
* Data discovery is a process of understanding data and extracting valuable insight from multiple data streams according to data uses and purposes.

## FAIR element(s)

* Findable: Data should be available in a discoverable resource (i.e. repository), have appropriate description (i.e. metadata) and have a persistent identifier (PID)
* Accessible: Data should be retrievable and understandable for both humans and machines
* Interoperable: Machines and humans can interpret and use the data in different settings and will be able to distinguish the metadata from the data file
* Reusable: The ultimate goal of FAIR is to advance the reuse of data in the future research and allow integration with other compatible data sources.

## Summary of Tasks / Actions

* Discussing reproducibility: why FAIR principles are important for data discovery?
* How do you search for data? See also the FAIRsharing educational factsheet for databases
    * Speaking about the process of data discovery, from developing a clear picture of the data to evaluating data quality.
    * Use lesson plan in (_Unit 1:_ _[Topic 3: Data Life Cycle approach to FAIR/FAIR right from the start](#heading=h.q1mn6pvbgcbv)_) to go through the data life cycle in the following scenario.

[Research data cycle](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/)

  * Present a researcher's story in any life science field and set up a search strategy. The story can be something like:

_“A Bio-Chemistry researcher needs some enzymology data for a research question: how enzymes are key factors to increase the rate of metabolism in the human body?”_

  * How did the researcher discover and access such data?
  * Did the researcher list the characteristics of the data  you want to discover
  * Evaluate the quality of data
  * Check the terms and conditions of access and use
    
* Let’s take the scenario above and look for any type of data you are interested about (e.g.‘mitochondrial beta-oxidation”) in different data sources:
    * [OpenAIRE - Research Graph](https://graph.openaire.eu/)
    * [OpenAIRE | Open Access](https://explore.openaire.eu/search/find?resultbestaccessright=%22Open%2520Access%22&fv0=miksa&f0=q&active=result)
    * [DataCite](https://datacite.org/)
    * [Re3data.org](https://www.re3data.org/)
    * [Dataset Search (google.com)](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/)
    * [FAIRsharing](https://fairsharing.org/)
      
* Of these resources,
        * Which one provided the most relevant data for your search terms? Which one provides facilities to refine your search ( i.e. filters)?
        * Try to search for more detailed search terms. How did the search results improve?
        * Is there a citation clarification for your selected data?Are there any differences in citation clarification between these data sources?
        * Can you find a licence for selected data? Is there any clarification how the data can be reused?

* How can data resources make data more discoverable by linking data to publications?
    * [Cross-linking between journal publications and data repositories: a selection of examples](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pcgqoUUlYZ1pNQBMNAteV2amCufRI89W/view?usp=sharing)
    * Service for data resources: [Europe PMC external links service](http://europepmc.org/LabsLink)

* Identifying innovative search tools for data discovery: demo on how to find the data behind a publication using[ Europe PMC](https://europepmc.org/), a literature database.
    * [Finding the data behind the publication with Europe PMC ](https://embl-ebi.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=13c9057b-f24f-44bf-9f3b-abc000f4852e)

* Citation, licences and copyrights help to clarify the “R” in the FAIR principles.

## Take home tasks/preparation

* Hands-on exercise:  Find the data behind a publication of your interest using [Europe PMC](https://europepmc.org/) and answer the questions:
    * Could you find the data citation on the publication?
    * Is the data linked to the data repository?
    * Could you access the data? Is the data format machine-readable?
    * Could you easily find the licensing for the data of interest?
    * How do you believe the use of FAIR principles contributed for your data discovery?
