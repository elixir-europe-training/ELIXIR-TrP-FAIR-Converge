learning_outcomes:
  1:
    outcome: Understand the benefits of virtual environments for reusability.
  2:
    outcome: Have sufficient understanding of modular scripting to identify it within a repository and translate a single (large) script into multiple (smaller) modules.
  3:
    outcome: Define version control and have a basic understanding of how git operates.
  4:
    outcome: Be able to critically assess whether automated testing might be worth implementing for a research software project.
