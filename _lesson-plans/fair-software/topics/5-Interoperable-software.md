    outcome: Be able to define vendor locking and why it is important to FAIR research software.
  2:
    outcome: Understand why the programming language itself can determine interoperability.
  3:

## Topic, definition and scope

* Open-source programming languages
* Input/output data
* Instructional documentation
* Vendor locking

---

## Exercises

* What programming languages do your research colleagues typically use? Are they open?
* What data formats are recommended within your organisation? Do they align with DANS?
* How might a research software be 'locked' (untentionally or unintentionally) by the developer?
