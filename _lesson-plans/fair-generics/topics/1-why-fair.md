description: >
  This topic introduces the general concept of FAIR, describing why potential and real stakeholders as well as other members of the community benefit from the implementation of the FAIR principles, as well as the increasing incentives from journals, funding bodies and institutions for emphasising FAIR as a factor for scientific impact. A fundamental understanding of FAIR and its role at all stages of research is vital for understanding the FAIR implementation process.

Making research data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) is of great importance in a data-driven world. Knowledge of the FAIR data principles and their practical application is crucial for maximising the value of data and resources, leading to more efficient research and increased knowledge sharing. By knowing of and adopting the FAIR principles, organisations and researchers can reach new levels of data and resource impacts, leading to numerous benefits for both the researcher community and society at large. 

Adopting and embracing the FAIR principles is a vital step towards advancing research and addressing complex challenges in all domains. Journals, institutions, and funding bodies are often requiring that research follows the FAIR principles (e.g., [Horizon Europe](https://horizoneuropencpportal.eu/sites/default/files/2022-09/ore-fair-data-guide.pdf) and [NIH](https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy/data-management#:~:text=NIH%20encourages%20data%20management%20and,repurposing%20datasets%20for%20secondary%20research)).

This lesson plan includes understanding of the importance of the FAIR principles for various stakeholders and the requirements of FAIR data set by journals, institutions, and funding bodies. Additionaly, it explores potential consequences of not applying the FAIR principles and the required changes for FAIR research practices in a project, group or organisation
