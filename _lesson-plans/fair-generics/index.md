    The contents of the lesson plans presented here are vital in providing an overview and building an understanding of fundamental concepts required to put the FAIR principles into practice and place them into a wider context. The FAIR generics lesson plan is divided into several topics organised as a progressive path where each topic can be viewed as a full or partial requirement for the next one:

This unit is about the generics of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable). It can be summarised as a concept promoting the use of standardised practices for organising and sharing data and resources, and focuses on making data (F)indable by assigning persistent identifiers and using rich, informative metadata to describe its content. By emphasising (A)ccessibility, it ensures that data can be accessed by both humans and machines, using open formats and providing clear access protocols. (I)nteroperability is achieved by adopting common data standards and formats, enabling data integration and exchange across different systems and platforms. Lastly, (R)eusability is emphasised by providing clear usage rights, as well as licensing and enabling data to be combined with other datasets. The generics of FAIR aim to maximise the potential impact of data and resources by making them more discoverable, accessible, and usable for both researchers and wider communities using programmatic and automatised methods.
