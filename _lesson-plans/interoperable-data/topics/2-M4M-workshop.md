audience:
  - This lesson plan is designed to train local trainers to facilitate M4M workshops in their local institutions (so a Train-the-Trainer)
  - "The audience of the M4M workshop itself are twofold (you need both of them to be in the training): Domain experts (who represent a domain community), FAIR metadata experts (data stewards) who guide a discussion leading to the metadata requirements that meet the FAIR data needs of that domain community"

## Topic, definition and scope



* Topic: Offering guidance on organising a Metadata for Machines (M4M) workshop in your local organisation
* Origin: GO FAIR Foundation, part of their “[Three-point FAIRification Framework](https://www.go-fair.org/how-to-go-fair/)” to offer guidance to make data FAIR
* Definition (GO FAIR; see below resources): 
    * M4M workshops are agile, hackathon-style events; they are lightweight, fast-track (often 1-day) events to build new, or make informed choices regarding the reuse of already existing metadata schema; they are usually intended to kick-start FAIRification efforts with minimally viable metadata components that are modular, and can be later extended as needed.
