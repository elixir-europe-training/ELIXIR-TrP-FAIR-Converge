# FAIR Lesson Plan Handbook

The FAIR Lesson Plan Handbook facilitates trainers to advance FAIR skills by helping them build training programs within life sciences research organisations. Many organisations struggle with training on how to implement FAIR in practice. The lesson plans are not a training in itself but offer a framework and learning paths to design FAIR trainings for specific audiences.
