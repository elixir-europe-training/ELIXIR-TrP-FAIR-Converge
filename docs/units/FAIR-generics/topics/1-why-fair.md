## Overview

Topic the lesson plan covers:
Making research data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) is of great importance in a data-driven world. Knowledge of the FAIR data principles and their practical application is crucial for maximising the value of data and resources, leading to more efficient research and increased knowledge sharing. This lesson plan includes general knowledge of what FAIR is, what different  stakeholders of the FAIR principles expect from researchers going FAIR and why/how they benefit from its implementation. 

The added value/benefit: 
By knowing of and adopting the FAIR principles, organisations and researchers can reach new levels of data and resource impacts, leading to numerous benefits for both the researcher community and society at large. 

The impact for the research: 
Adopting and embracing the FAIR principles is a vital step towards advancing research and addressing complex challenges in all domains. The journals, institutions, and funding bodies are now requiring more and more often that the research follows the FAIR principles ([Horizon Europe](https://horizoneuropencpportal.eu/sites/default/files/2022-09/ore-fair-data-guide.pdf) and [NIH](https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy/data-management#:~:text=NIH%20encourages%20data%20management%20and,repurposing%20datasets%20for%20secondary%20research) requirements).

## Alignment with FAIR principles
The topic of "Why FAIR" aligns with all aspects of FAIR in a more general way than other topics. It includes general knowledge of what FAIR is, what different  stakeholders of the FAIR principles expect from researchers going FAIR and why/how they benefit from its implementation. There are also incentives such as requirements from journals, institutions, and funding bodies. Exemplary recommendations from major entities include the ones from [Horizon 2020](https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/grants_manual/hi/oa_pilot/h2020-hi-oa-data-mgt_en.pdf), [UKRI](https://www.ukri.org/manage-your-award/publishing-your-research-findings/making-your-research-data-open/), [EOSC](https://eosc.eu/events/monitoring-eosc-readiness-fair-data-policies/), and [NIH](https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy/data-management#:~:text=NIH%20encourages%20data%20management%20and,repurposing%20datasets%20for%20secondary%20research).

## Topic, definition and scope

* What is FAIR? (FAIRsFAIR lesson plan available [“FAIR in a nutshell”](https://fairsfair.gitbook.io/fair-teaching-handbook/0lessonplans/1lessonplan))
* Who are the stakeholders? Answers to FAIR questions are different for the different stakeholders (researchers, organisations,  management, society)
* Generic answers to **why** different stakeholders benefit from implementing the FAIR principles 
* Motivation to implement FAIR: (depends on stakeholder)
    * Why make data Findable?
    * Why make data Accessible?
    * Why make data Interoperable?
    * Why make data Reusable?
* Benefits for different roles/levels (individual researcher vs scientific/discipline knowledge vs societal)
* Incentives such as requirements from journals, institutions, and funding bodies. Exemplary recommendations from major entities include the ones from [Horizon 2020](https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/grants_manual/hi/oa_pilot/h2020-hi-oa-data-mgt_en.pdf), [UKRI](https://www.ukri.org/manage-your-award/publishing-your-research-findings/making-your-research-data-open/), [EOSC](https://eosc.eu/events/monitoring-eosc-readiness-fair-data-policies/), [NIH](https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy/data-management#:~:text=NIH%20encourages%20data%20management%20and,repurposing%20datasets%20for%20secondary%20research).

## Lesson content

The "Why FAIR?" lesson plan introduces the FAIR principles in a general way by explaining the meaning and intention of each letter of the FAIR acronym one by one, and how they relate to each other.

## Summary of Tasks / Actions

* Introduction to FAIR principles
    * Explanation of each letter (focus on **what** it means) (link to [FAIRsFAIR lesson plan, slide 1-19](https://zenodo.org/record/5078286), [The FAIR principles explained - Maastricht University](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OeCrQE3HhE), [Make your research data F.A.I.R](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIwHJ6DkFdc), Cessda training, NL, [DCC PO FAIR datamanagement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL8L0fHgdI0)).

* Identify common stakeholders related to FAIR usage in the following links, and group them in the following three categories; perform (p), facilitate (f) and benefit (b). ([link](https://genestack.com/resources/library/the-fair-principles-of-data-management/), ([link](https://www.rd-alliance.org/sites/default/files/RDA-SHARC%20Poster%20template%20Melbourne%20-%202020%20V10032020%20.jpg))

* For each stakeholder identified in the previous exercise, go through each letter of FAIR and explore why they should be motivated to implement each principle. Think about incentives on an individual, scientific, and societal level (show example table below).

* Summarise the cost of not having FAIR data - estimated as €10.2bn per year! ([link](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/d375368c-1a0a-11e9-8d04-01aa75ed71a1/language-en))

## Materials / Equipment

* Fact sheets with summary (broad audience) - zenodo pub?
* eBook (background information for a broader audience, maybe not citizens, but including management) - published where? zenodo?
* Best practices examples of FAIR data (researchers) interactive sessions
* [FAIRification framework recipe](https://faircookbook.elixir-europe.org/content/recipes/introduction/fairification-process.html) from the FAIR Cookbook

---

## Take home tasks/preparation

* Preparation: read the fact sheet with the summary.
* Take home: 
    * Identify opportunities to apply FAIR principles in your own organisation
    * Identify benefits from applying FAIR principles in your own organisation
    * Template document for each FAIR principle - researcher has to go through each point and write down what they will do in their dataset for F, A, I, R.? Maybe even each of the F1, F2, F3, F4?
    * An understanding of how this framework guides FAIRification might help. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-023-02167-2  \
