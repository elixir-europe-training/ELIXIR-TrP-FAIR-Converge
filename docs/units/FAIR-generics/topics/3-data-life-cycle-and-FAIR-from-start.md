## Topic, definition and scope

* Understanding data life cycle and its use in a research project.
* Understanding how each step in the lifecycle supports making research data FAIR by-design.

---

## Duration

Duration will be adjusted based on the overall scheme of the course, the audience and the delivery format.

* For webinar or tutorial, one hour is foreseen.
* For more interactive trainings it can be a morning/afternoon session

---

## Summary of Tasks / Actions

* Exercise for audience: List the research life cycle phases and the applicable FAIR elements with explanations
* Prepare an exercise for the audience: using a particular tool to assess FAIRness in your research data/research data of researchers that you are supporting _(maybe this exercise is more suitable in other units? Instructors can also provide datasets)_
* Exercise for audience: Try to find datasets (through a repository) that are FAIR
* Exercise: play games (see references)

---

## Materials / Equipment

* Overview of different research data life cycle models
* Computer / laptop
* Internet / browser
* Whiteboard + markers
* Post-its
* Pre-reading material?
* Examples (good and not as good)?

## Preparation/getting to know the audience

* Motivation to follow the training
* Experience with FAIR research data

## Take home message

* You can relate different elements in DMP or in a research project in general to different phases of the data life cycle.
* When looking at the different phases of your own research project, you know which methods / tools can you apply to make your research FAIR
