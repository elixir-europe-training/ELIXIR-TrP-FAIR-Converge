## Overview

### Objective
Participants will understand the significance of rich metadata in the context of life sciences datasets, learn how to describe and search for datasets using metadata standards, and recognise the role metadata standards play in dataset discovery. The focus is on FAIR principle F2, which is primarily about discovery from both a generic and a domain-specific perspective.

### Added value
The more generous and comprehensive datasets are described, both for humans and computers, the more specifically findable (in a meaningful way) it becomes in refined searches.

### Impact for research
To do.

## Lesson outline


<!-- 
The text below is 'old' but contains stuff that should somehow incorporated into the table
* Metadata
    * Definition of metadata 
    * Types of metadata
    * Characteristics of Metadata
* Metadata standards
    * Definition of metadata standards
    * Metadata standards formats
    * Definition of controlled vocabularies and ontologies
* Benefits of metadata and standards 
* How to create Metadata and use standards
    * Find
    * Create
    * Use Case


## Summary of Tasks / Actions

* Describing Metadata and expanding on different types
        * Find out more with FAIRsharing’s factsheet on standards
        * From a Data producer point:
    * **Exercise: **Identify which types of data and metadata is relevant in your field
* Describing Metadata standards and expanding on their use, formats
    * **Exercise: **Identify metadata standards relevant to your current work/experiment
    * **Exercise: **Which format and how are you able to use it/edit it?
    * **Exercise: **Identify relevant repository and repository requirements related to your data type
    * **Exercise: **Assess the quality of the metadata standard and how it fulfils the FAIR principles
* Discussing the benefits of metadata and standards, importance in relation to FAIR
        * From a data consumer point:
    * **Exercise:** Identify a dataset from a repository and check your understanding of the dataset via the metadata provided, in other words, describe the dataset without looking at it.
    * **Exercise:**Can you identify examples from everyday life illustrating the use of metadata standards?
* Expanding on practical ways to create and use Metadata and standards
    * **Exercise: **Identify** **available tools (if any) for creating and manipulation of metadata relevant to your field

---
## Take home tasks/preparation

* Find a repository relevant to your field (e.g. use FAIRsharing)
* Identify which metadata standard relevant to your data type is used in this repository
* Create metadata for your dataset using metadata standard from repository
* Identify a dataset of interest from your field via metadata search
