      title: Defining research software
      link: 'topics/1-Defining-research-software'
      description: >
        This topic introduces the topic of research software. We provide a definition of research software and in doing so make a clear distinction between 'research software' and 'software in research'. We outline why the development and manangement of research software is important and clarify its placement within the research cycle. We also cover some of the challenges facing (the development of) research software in the current academic landscape.

      title: FAIR software
      link: 'topics/2-FAIR-software'
      description: >
        This topic maps the FAIR framework onto research software. We assume that participants have basic knowledge of the generics of FAIR (data) from previous modules and instead focus on explaining how the FAIR framework for research software can facilitate code re-use, ensure reproducibility of computational workflows, make replication studies easier, save research time, and speed-up scientific progress.

      title: Findable software
      link: 'topics/3-Findable-software'
      description: >
        This topic details how to ensure research software is Findable by covering the fundamentals of software directories, personal identifiers, software metadata and clear descriptive information (e.g., README). 
    - number: 6.4
      title: Accessible software
      link: 'topics/4-Accessible-software'
      description: >
        This topic explains how to make research software Accessible by raising awareness about licencing and public software repositories. We offer advice on how to best choose an appropriate licence for research software and provide guidance that helps attendees better understand the pros and cons of different software repositories (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket).

      title: Interoperable software
      link: 'topics/5-Interoperable-software'
      description: >
        This topic outlines how research software can be made Interoperable by using common, open-source programming languages (e.g, R, Python) and by ensuring that research software is usable with open-format input and output data.
    - number: 6.6
      title: Reusable software
      link: 'topics/6-Reusable-software'
      description: >
        This topic address the reusability of research software. Reusability relies on many of the factors already covered, including licencing, public repositories and clear documentation. But to encourage and facilitate re-use further, research software should use a modular coding structure, version control (e.g., git), virtual environments, and in some cases automated testing, to enhance reproducibility.

This unit is about FAIR research software. We define research software as code that has been created during the research process, such as analysis scripts or reusable tools. The unit maps the generics of the FAIR framework to research software and outlines how such an approach can add value to science by enhancing computational reproducibility, speeding-up scientific progress through code re-use, facilitating replications and saving research time. We then provide guidance on how the FAIR principals can be implemented. (F)indable research software is archived within a software directory, has a clear description, personal identifier(s) and appropriate metadata. A(accesible) research software is hosted on a public software repository (e.g., GitHub) using an appropriate (open) licence. (I)interoperable research software uses common, open-source programming languages and uses open formats for input and output data. R(usable) research software, in addition to having an appropriate licence, and a public repository, is clearly documented, uses modular coding practices, version control and sufficient tests and environment snapshots to ensure reproducibility.
