# ELIXIR FAIR Lesson Plans 

Are you a trainer and looking for material on teaching researchers or your peers (trainers, data stewards, policy makers etc.) on FAIR data? Do you want community help in creating inspiring FAIR data lessons? Then this FAIR Lesson Plan handbook might be of use, providing you guidance on teaching about FAIR data to integrate in your organisation's curriculum. 

The FAIR Lesson Plan handbook facilitates trainers to advance FAIR skills by helping them build training programs within life sciences research organisations. Many organisations struggle with training on how to implement FAIR in practice. The lesson plans are not a training in itself but offer a framework and learning paths to design FAIR trainings for specific audiences. 

The FAIR lesson plans have been created in a community effort from over 50 contributors. For each FAIR element, the lesson plans contain brief introductions to relevant topics and offer suggestions for tasks and actions and key materials. Learning outcomes are specified for each topic. 

Learning paths show how trainers and learners can design their own training programme and give insight in learning goals and pre-required knowledge. 



Note that the FAIR Lesson Plan handbook is still under development, as part of various hackathons-style events that have been organised with the (beyond life sciences) community since June 2022. The FAIR Lesson Plan Handbook is an initiative of [ELIXIR](https://elixir-europe.org/), and is based on the [FAIRsFAIR Teaching Handbook](https://fairsfair.gitbook.io/fair-teaching-handbook/) and its [FAIR lesson plans](https://fairsfair.gitbook.io/fair-teaching-handbook/0lessonplans). The FAIR Lesson Plan Handbook builds on existing ELIXIR resources such as RDMkit and the ELIXIR/NPOS Data Stewards Competency Framework and outcomes from other projects such as the FAIR Cookbook.
